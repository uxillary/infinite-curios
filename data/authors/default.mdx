## About Me

Hey, I’m Adam – a creative digital developer who loves creating tools and exploring ideas. Infinite Curios is my space to share  blogs and other experiments that don’t always fit into a box.

I jump between web development, gaming, AI experiments, writing, and anything else that sparks interest. I like to keep things minimal, but not boring – functional, but playful.
