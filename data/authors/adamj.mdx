At birth, Ged was given the child-name Duny by his mother. He was born on the island of Gont, as a son of a bronzesmith. His mother died before he reached the age of one. As a small boy, Ged had overheard the village witch, his maternal aunt, using various words of power to call goats. Ged later used the words without an understanding of their meanings, to surprising effect.

The witch knew that using words of power effectively without understanding them required innate power, so she endeavored to teach him what little she knew. After learning more from her, he was able to call animals to him. Particularly, he was seen in the company of wild sparrowhawks so often that his "use name" became Sparrowhawk.

## About Me

Hey, I’m Adam – a curious creator who loves building tools, exploring ideas, and making things that actually *do* something. Infinite Curios is my space to share projects, blogs, and experiments that don’t always fit into a box.

I jump between web development, gaming, AI, crypto mining, writing, and anything else that sparks interest. I like to keep things minimal, but not boring – functional, but playful.

When I’m not working on this site, you’ll probably find me:
- Crafting weird YouTube videos
- Building Minecraft levels
- Tinkering with Python scripts
- Chasing ideas that may or may not work

Infinite Curios isn’t just a portfolio – it’s a sandbox for all the things I find interesting. Thanks for stopping by.
