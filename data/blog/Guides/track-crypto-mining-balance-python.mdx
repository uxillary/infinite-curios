# How to Track Your Crypto Mining Balance with Python (Step-by-Step)

If you mine cryptocurrency like **Monero (XMR)**, keeping an eye on your unpaid balance helps you know when a payout is coming. This guide walks through building a small Python script that checks your balance via the [SupportXMR](https://supportxmr.com) pool API. We'll also look at [tray-xmr](https://github.com/uxillary/tray-xmr), a handy project that displays your balance in the Windows system tray.

## 1. Set Up Your Python Environment

You'll need Python 3 and `requests` installed:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests
```

## 2. Fetch Your Balance from SupportXMR

Create a file named `check_balance.py` and paste the code below, replacing `YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS` with your actual XMR address:

```python
import requests

WALLET = 'YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS'
URL = f'https://supportxmr.com/api/miner/{WALLET}/stats'

resp = requests.get(URL, timeout=10)
data = resp.json()
balance = data.get('stats', {}).get('balance', data.get('amtDue', 0)) / 1e12
print(f'Current balance: {balance:.6f} XMR')
```

Run the script with `python check_balance.py` to see your current unpaid balance.

## 3. Get Desktop Notifications with tray-xmr

The [tray-xmr](https://github.com/uxillary/tray-xmr) project expands on this idea. It shows your balance in a tray icon and notifies you when you're ready for payout. Clone the repo and run the script inside the `v1` directory (Windows is required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uxillary/tray-xmr.git
cd tray-xmr/v1
python xmr_tray.py
```

The app checks your balance once an hour and pops up a notification when you reach the payout threshold.

## 4. Customize the Script

Feel free to modify `xmr_tray.py` or your own script to adjust the check interval, notification text, or payout threshold. Since the project is open source, you can adapt it for other mining pools or even integrate it with a dashboard.

## Conclusion

With just a bit of Python, you can automatically monitor your mining rewards and get notified when it's time to cash out. Exploring the tray-xmr project is a great way to see how a simple script can evolve into a helpful desktop utility.
