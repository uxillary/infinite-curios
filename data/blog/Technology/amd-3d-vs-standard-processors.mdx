# AMD 3D V-Cache vs Standard Ryzen Processors

AMD's recent lineup of chips with "3D" in the name refers to the inclusion of **3D V-Cache**, a technique that stacks extra L3 cache vertically on top of the compute die. Models such as the Ryzen 7 5700 3D take a regular Zen 3 processor and add an additional layer of cache, allowing far more data to be stored close to the cores.

## What is 3D V-Cache?

Traditional processors keep their L3 cache on the same horizontal plane as the cores. With 3D V-Cache, AMD uses a thin piece of silicon to stack more cache on top, connecting it with tiny TSVs (through-silicon vias). This arrangement dramatically increases cache capacity without expanding the processor's footprint.

## Gaming Benefits

Games often benefit from large pools of fast cache because game engines regularly fetch small chunks of data—like level geometry, textures, or AI state—from memory. When more of this data can stay in the L3 cache, the CPU spends less time waiting on slower system RAM. As a result, average and minimum frame rates improve, particularly in CPU-bound titles.

In benchmarks, processors with 3D V-Cache tend to show higher performance in games compared to their standard equivalents, even if their base clock speeds are similar. The extra cache helps keep the execution units fed with instructions, which is why models like the Ryzen 7 5700 3D punch above their weight in gaming scenarios.

## Synergy With GPUs

Modern GPUs rely on the CPU to quickly deliver draw calls, physics calculations, and other game logic. When the CPU can process these tasks faster—thanks to the large 3D V-Cache—the GPU gets work more consistently and avoids stalling. This synergy means that pairing a high-end GPU with a 3D V-Cache processor can unlock additional performance headroom compared to a standard chip.

3D V-Cache doesn't directly increase graphics horsepower, but it reduces CPU bottlenecks that might otherwise hold back a powerful graphics card. This is especially noticeable at lower resolutions where the CPU has a bigger impact on overall frame rates.

## Choosing Between 3D and Non-3D Chips

If your workflow is heavily gaming focused, a 3D V-Cache model offers better value per frame. For general productivity or heavily multi-threaded workloads, the non-3D versions may deliver similar results at a lower cost because those tasks aren't as sensitive to cache size. Ultimately, 3D V-Cache is an elegant solution to squeeze extra gaming performance out of the Zen architecture without raising power draw or drastically changing other specifications.
